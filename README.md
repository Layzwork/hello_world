Initial repository to share ideas resources and share things with others.

Hello world,

Layzwork is the name and coding is the game. I am an avid Chelsea FC, and Real Madrid fan. It's not wrong to have two favorite teams.
Anyways I am excited to learn about code and this will not be my last repository.
